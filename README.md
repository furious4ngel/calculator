# Calculator
This project is a calculator that performs basic arithmetic.

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## What I Learned
### HTML
I don't need IDs to target elements in JavaScript.
Classes can be used to target them too.

### CSS
I learned a little more about Grid for the calculator. Placing
the buttons and display in the calculator was simple and proved to
be the better choice for building the calculator than Flexbox.

I also used the not pseudo-class for the first time. It was
helpful for targeting specific elements that I did not want
styled.

### JS
I believe my JavaScript looks much cleaner this time. However,
there is definitely room for improvement.
